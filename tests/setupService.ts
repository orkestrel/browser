/**
 * Readiness setup for the `service` project.

 * `tests/service/` resolves its browser through `requireSystemBrowser`, which throws a
 * named error naming what to install when the host has none, so a browserless machine
 * fails the project loudly instead of reporting a green run over proofs that never
 * executed. `tests/setupService.test.ts` pins that contract over the whole directory.
 *
 * Readiness resolves on call rather than at module load, so this module stays importable
 * by its own proof in the `setup` project, which `npm test` runs on any host.
