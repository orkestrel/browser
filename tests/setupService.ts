 * fails the project loudly instead of reporting a green run over proofs that never
 * executed. `tests/setupService.test.ts` pins that contract over the whole directory.
 *
 * Readiness resolves on call rather than at module load, so this module stays importable
 * by its own proof in the `setup` project, which `npm test` runs on any host.
